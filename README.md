- Underfitting: model hasn't been adapted enough to training data
- Model | Network: Function take feature input return prediction
- epoch: Each iteration to a complete set of training
- optimizer: The algorithm by which the network will update its weights (ker-nel and bias) based on the data and the loss function. 
- Loss function: An error measurement. How the network measures its performance on the training data and steers itself in the right direction.
